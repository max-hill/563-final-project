# Script Readme
(Last updated: 2021-04-09)

A short descriptions of each script is given. Additional, more complete
documentation for each script can be found as commentary in the files
themselves.

# Scripts
* [simulate.sh](simulate.sh) contains the script for starting up a simulation
  under a pre-specified parameter regime. It is intended to be run from the
  command line by the user (i.e. you). There are three simulation types to
  choose from.

* [simulator.lisp](simulator.lisp) contains all general functions for simulating
  the multispecies coalescent with recombination on a three-taxa species tree with
  topology ((AB)C). It also contains the functions necessary for inference,
  including:
     1. R* consensus method using weighted Jukes-Cantor distances;
     2. R* consensus method using mutations generated by a Jukes-Cantor process;
     3. A summary method which infers the maximum likelihood tree.

* [make-plots.R](make-plots.R) automatically loops over all .csv files contained
  in the `data/` directory and makes a plot for each one. The plots are output
  to the `analysis/` directory. Current functionality is limited but will be
  expanded to create more plots.

* [execute-ml-sequence.lisp](execute-ml-consensus.lisp) simulates the evolution
  of a length of DNA across three sister species A, B, and C whos species tree
  has topology ((AB)C). For each

* [execute-jc-sequence.lisp](execute-jc-sequence.lisp) not written yet, but
  should be almost copy-paste of the other execute files.

* [execute-jc-expected.lisp](execute-jc-expected.lisp) RENAME FROM
  execute-consensus-jc.lisp ann EDIT so that it is similar to execute
  ml-sequence
