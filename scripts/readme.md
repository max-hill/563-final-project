# Script Readme
(Last updated: 2021-04-29)

A short descriptions of each script is given. Additional, more complete
documentation for each script can be found as commentary in the files
themselves.

# Scripts
* [simulate.sh](simulate.sh) contains the script for starting up a simulation
  under a set of parameter regimes as specified in the file
  [simulation-parameters.lisp](simulation-parameters.lisp). It is intended to be
  run from the command line by the user (i.e. you). There are three simulation
  types to choose from.
  
* [simulation-parameters.lisp](simulation-parameters.lisp) is a document which
  specifies the range of parameter regimes to be simulated.

* [simulator.lisp](simulator.lisp) contains all general functions for simulating
  the multispecies coalescent with recombination on a three-taxa species tree with
  topology ((AB)C). It also contains the functions necessary for inference,
  including:
     1. JC-Expected: R* consensus method using expected evolutionary (Hamming) distances
        under the Jukes-Cantor 1969 model of site evolution;
     2. JC-Sequence: R* consensus method using mutations generated by a Jukes-Cantor process;
     3. ML-Sequence: Binary seqeuences with maximum likielihood gene trees under
        the symmetric mutation process (ie 0 --> 1 and 1 --> 0 at equal rates).

* [make-plots.R](make-plots.R) contains R code for creating all plots in my
  project report from the simulation data contained in the `data` directory. The
  plots are output to the `analysis/` directory. This file can be run from bash
  using Rscript (see project.md for instructions), or individual plots can be
  created by copying parts of the code into an R REPL.
