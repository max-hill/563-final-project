I am currently writing a program to simulate sequence data parametrized by a fixed species tree. The goal is to study the impact of intralocus recombination on inference of the species tree topology, especially in the context where recombination rates differ between species. 

The simulator is based on the multispecies coalescent. We assume there are 3 species whose phylogeny is characterized by a species tree with topology ((AB)C) and specified edge lengths and edge-specific recombination-parameters. Gene trees are then generated within each single species according to the Ancestral Recombination Graph model (Griffiths and Marjoram 1997). Sequences are then generated by scattering mutations along the edges of gene trees as a Poisson process.

Analyses will include (1) species tree inference using R* and STEAC, and (2) an attempt to replicate some analyses (e.g. *BEAST) used in (Lanier and Knowles 2012).
