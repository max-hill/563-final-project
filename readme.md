# Final Project for Phylo-Class 563
(Last updated 2021-04-09)

Project summary: In this project I simulate genetic data subject to intralocus recombination under various parameter regimes (mutation rate, species tree branch lengths, recombination rates, etc) in order evaluate the robustness of summary coalescent methods to violations of the "no intralocus recombination" assumption. 

For the draft overview of my project and reproducible script, see [notebook-log.md](notebook-log.md).

For further information on the scripts used, see the [scripts readme](scripts/readme.md) in the `scripts` directory.
