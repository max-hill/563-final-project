# Final Project for Phylo-Class 563
	(Last updated 2021-04-29)


## Project Overview
In this project I simulate genetic data subject to intralocus recombination
under various parameter regimes (mutation rate, species tree branch lengths,
recombination rates, etc) in order evaluate the robustness of summary coalescent
methods to violations of the "no intralocus recombination" assumption.

For my project report and detailed instructions for reproducing my results, see
[report.md](report.md).

For further information on the scripts used, see the [scripts
readme](scripts/readme.md).

Datafiles are cotnained in the `data/` directory. Plots are contained in the
`analysis/` directory.


## Todo
* Finish project report. 
* Plan some longer simulations.
